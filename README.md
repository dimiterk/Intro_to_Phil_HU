Introduction to Philosophy Course

Course description

This online course will introduce students to philosophy using our new digital overlord ChatGPT by exploring the questions about intelligence, ethics, and personality that arise about ChatGPT. ChatGPT is turning out to be a tool that would transform how we learn and work (am I--a professor in Philosophy--going to be replaced by ChatGPT? Are you going to be out of a job? Should we be worried?). As such, it is essential that we learn about it in order to prepare for the future. Some lectures will be hybrid--both ChatGPT and your instructor would present and field questions! This course will meet MWF to discuss material that students examine on their own on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There will be 2 take home exams (2-3 days to complete, 2 tries, highest grade counts) and a brief essay where students will present their views on the topic of ChatGPT. Students juggling work with this course will be accommodated.
